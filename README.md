# Philips Avance SVG Extruder

This is a customizable die for the [Philips Avance pasta maker](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/HR2375_06/avance-collection-pasta-maker#see-all-benefits).  Open the scad file in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), open the customizer, and paste in the path of an 11mm x 11mm SVG file ([clover.svg](https://github.com/Fordi/philips-avance-extruder/blob/main/clover.svg) is included as an example).  The solid path areas are where the pasta will come out.  There is a 1mm cross behind the object to act as supports, so make your designs with that in mind.

Once the file has loaded and OpenSCAD has given up on the preview render (it's too complex), press F6 to do a full render that you can inspect.  When you're ready, press F7 to export an STL file.

Note that I do not own a Philips Avance, nor have I even printed this Thing.  The design is based on [Lcha's Tagliatelle die](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4331203).  If you do use this, please _do_ [contact me using a github issue](https://github.com/Fordi/philips-avance-extruder/issues) with your experience and any adjustments you'd have me make in the code.
